					<p>For my midterm project, I have choose to use the background black mainly because I couldn't
						find a image with just the topdog logo and was struggling to crop the logo perfectly. When
						I copy and pasted the logo the black background came along with it as well as the open daily description.
						In order to compensate the black background, most of the text colors are colors that doesn't hurt the eye as much
						with black backgrounds, such as dark yellow and light grey. For quotes, I decided to use a font call Great Vibes since
						I think it can fit well with the quote. I added buttons to menu and other common menu bar items on a website.
						I also added a few pictures of the food to showcase topdogs great food. For menu, I decided to lay it out like that to create
						some asymmetry, which is a cool design choice. I also had some margins between most sections becuase my eyes
						felt tired when everything is too clustered together. I didn't add margin between photos for the main page 
						because it looked ugly with spacing. I also added a button at the very bottom for people to click on to go to menu.
