                <li>I learned that you should keep an eye on what works and what not. It is good practice to pay attention to details while doing something or using an app</li>
                <li>I like how to write breaks down app building and design into different components for us to reflect. The hireachy of design questions were really reflective</li>
                <li>Don’t just use apps, study them</li>
