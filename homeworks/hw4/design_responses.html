						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned how important color is important. I never really thought about color accessibility because I never run into that issue. It made me forget how some other people will need the contrast to identify information. I also learned how we can use color contrast and iconology to create my accessibility.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think the favorite part of the article is how it shows us ways to create color accessibility. I also like how it divides into sections explaining each method. The picture examples also really help with my visualization. I also like the tone of the author which makes the article more entertaining to read. </p>
