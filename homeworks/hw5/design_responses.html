                            <p> You learn best by looking and doing for UI. I feel like reading does give you ideas but it is not as effective as visualizing it. I also learned about how much potential there is for desiging UI interaction </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part is seeing all the different types of design choices. I think I can learn a lot through looking. Not having any text here is also an interesting choice. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I really like story's log in page transformation. It is so cool and dope, and I think it really hooked me with the sudden transformation. I also really like the travel map design. It acheives its goal of eliminating options by visually breaking the option box. It is really cool in my opinion.</p>

                            <p> 9, since it is really cool to see these different types of UI interaction. I think I can learn from these designs. </p>
