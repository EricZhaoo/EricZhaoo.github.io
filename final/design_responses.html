					<p>For my final project, I originally planned to create a website similar to spotify or a personal website,
						but due to time constraint, I decided to make like a webpage game. I wanted to do brick breaker but I ran into
						a lot of bugs, so I changed it to tic tac toe instead. One of the feautures that I implemented is a loading screen
						with css and javascript. I added a loading circle with number as well as a rolling soccer (similar to lab 6) to make it
						less boring to wait. Then, it will transition to the main game page. I think this feature just makes the website seem more like
						a game vibe/interaction. I implemented a toggle button to change to light mode
						(similar to lab 8) and change cursor when hovering over the board. I think providing a different mode is beneficial to the user
						since they can pick whats better for their eyes. When the game finishes, they will be a pop up alert
						telling you the game will restart soon and it will reload the page.
